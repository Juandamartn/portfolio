## Description

More than a simple portfolio, here I pretend to put all my knowledge I've been acquired through time. Maybe this site doesn't seem to have a decent structure matching through all the sections, there's a landing page showing the main info about my career, but also I recently implemented a blog manager to post some notes to the community and so on.

In the future, I'll be adding more stuff to this page just for fun or showing the people what I can do as a developer.

Please, enjoy this project that I'm doing with love ðŸ’š
